# Sorting-Visualizer

The concept of visualizing algorithms lets us understand algorithms in a much better way.

This project is built using ReactJS.
It includes visualization of few classic sorting algorithms such as: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Insertion Sort.

# Components

It consists of 4 main components.

1. **Header:** This component is just a text animation of the text "Sorting Visualizer".

2. **Buttons Bar:** This component includes few buttons which are used to start visualizing algorithms.
